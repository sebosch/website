__Open Science__\
I am the Chief Open Science Officer at VU Amsterdam.
In this role, I connect existing initiatives on [__Open Science__](https://vu.nl/openscience "Website VU Open Science") and initiate and manage projects that work towards necessary Infrastructure, Support & Training, Community Engagement, Recognition & Rewards and Policy for Open Science. I strive to make the scientific process more transparent and its pillars (FAIR & Responsible Research, Public Engagement & Impact, and FAIR & Open Education) more fairly and evenly appreciated.

In 2022, I took up the role of Portfolio Manager at the Dutch National Programme Open Science (NPOS). In this role, I was responsible for the creation of a Multi-Annual Plan (NPOS2030), which contains the vision, [__shared ambitions__](https://www.openscience.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NPOS_AmbitionDocument.pdf "NPOS Ambition Document") and key objectives of a broad consortium of Dutch Open Science stakeholders.\
Since June 2023 I represent the Universities of the Netherlands [__(UNL)__](https://www.universiteitenvannederland.nl/en_GB "UNL") as a steering board member for the [__National Initiative Open Science NL (OSNL)__](https://www.nwo.nl/en/news/steering-board-open-science-nl-appointed "OSNL").  


__Research__\
I completed my PhD at the [__Donders Institute__](https://www.ru.nl/donders/ "Website Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition & Behaviour"), in the group of [__Prof. dr. Christian Doeller__](https://doellerlab.com/ "Website Doellerlab"), where I combined psychophysics, fMRI and multivariate analyses to investigate hippocampal memory retrieval.
As as postdoctoral researcher, I worked with [__Prof dr. Marcel van Gerven__](https://artcogsys.com/ "Website ArtCogSys") and his Artificial Cognitive Systems group. In several research projects, I applied state-of-the art methods from artificial intelligence to study learning, perception and imagery.
