I'm the Open Science Coordinator at the VU Amsterdam and a postdoctoral researcher at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour.

As an Open Science Coordinator, I'm initiating and managing projects that promote open access, open data, open software and open education at the VU. I strive to make the scientific process more transparent and its pillars (research, education, communication, leadership) more fairly and evenly appreciated.

At the Donders Institute, I work with [Prof dr. Marcel van Gerven](https://artcogsys.com/ "ArtCogSys website") and his Artificial Cognitive Systems group. In several research projects, I apply state-of-the art methods from artificial intelligence to study learning, perception and imagery.
<br/>I completed my PhD in the group of [Prof. dr. Christian Doeller](https://doellerlab.com/ "Doellerlab website"), where I combined psychophysics, fMRI and multivariate analyses to investigate hippocampal memory retrieval.

My interests include open science initiatives, the neural mechanisms of cognition, artificial intelligence and data science.
