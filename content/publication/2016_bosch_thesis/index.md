abstract = "_The Time Traveller: “Well, I do not mind telling you I have been at work upon this geometry of Four Dimensions for some time. Some of my results are curious. For instance, here is a portrait of a man at eight years old, another at fifteen, another at seventeen, another at twenty-three, and so on. All these are evidently sections, as it were, Three-Dimensional representations of his four-Dimensioned being, which is a fixed and unalterable thing (…)<br><br>The Medical Man: ’But (…) if Time is really only a fourth dimension of Space, why is it, and why has it always been, regarded as something different? And why cannot we move in Time as we move about in the other dimensions of Space? (…) you cannot move at all in Time, you cannot get away from the present moment.”<br><br>The Time Traveller: “(…) you are wrong to say that we cannot move about in Time. For instance, if I am recalling an incident very vividly I go back to the instant of its occurrence: I become absent-minded, as you say. I jump back for a moment.”_<br><br>The Time Machine, H.G. Wells, pp. 33-37"
