I'm a project manager Research Support at the VU Amsterdam and a postdoctoral researcher at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour.
<br/>At the VU, I'm leading several projects related to research data management and research intelligence.
<br/>At the Donders Institute, I work with Marcel van Gerven and his Artificial Cognitive Systems group, where I apply state-of-the art methods from artificial intelligence to study learning, perception and imagery.
<br/>I completed my PhD in the group of Christian Doeller, where I combined psychophysics, fMRI and multivariate analyses to investigate hippocampal memory retrieval.

My interests include the neural mechanisms of cognition, artificial intelligence, data science and open science initiatives.
