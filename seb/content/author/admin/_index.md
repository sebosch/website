I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour. Currently, I'm working with Marcel van Gerven and his Artificial Cognitive Systems group. Here, I'm applying state-of-the art methods from artificial intelligence to study learning, perception and imagery. 

I completed my PhD in the group of Christian Doeller, where I combined psychophysics, fMRI and multivariate analyses to investigate hippocampal memory retrieval.

I'm interested in the neural mechanisms of learning, memory and perception.
